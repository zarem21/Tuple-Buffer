# Tuple-Buffer

/*
* Function receives a character buffer containing snippets (partial or full)
* of tuples in string form. Fader interprets the tuple and sets the variables ledTargetInt
* and ledFadeTime. 
* 
* Incomplete snippets are buffered. Incorrect tuples are discarded. Buffer is never overrun.
* Upon seeing the right-brace '}', The tuple is checked for correct and usable form.
*
* Tuple is: '{' offON ',' maxInt ',' fadeTime '}'
*
*	offON := 0 | 1;
*	maxInt := 0 - 8191; 	// 13-bit PWM duty resolution
*	fadeTime := 0 - 10000;	// 10-thousand milliseconds
